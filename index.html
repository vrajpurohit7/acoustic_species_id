            <h2>Welcome to the Acoustic Species Identification Project</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on classifying bird vocalizations and extends previous work from Engineers for Exploration (E4E). We are developing techniques to overcome challenges in audio data classification due to domain shift from labeled training data to unlabeled, noisy field recordings.</p>
            <p>Our objective is to leverage modern machine learning architectures and domain-specific adaptations to accurately identify bird species from acoustic data. This work is part of our broader efforts to aid ecological research and conservation through advanced bioacoustic classification systems.</p>
            <p>Currently, we are working on implementing and evaluating various machine learning models, including CNNs and newer RNN architectures, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our identification systems. Our work contributes to the BirdCLEF 2024 competition on Kaggle, aiming to push the boundaries of current bioacoustic research.</p>

            <h2>Ensemble Learning Strategy</h2>
            <p>We use ensemble learning methods to enhance the accuracy of our bird species identification project, which is part of the BirdCLEF competition focusing on identifying bird sounds from complex audio environments. This competition requires analyzing diverse audio data, including noisy field recordings with overlapping bird calls. Our approach combines several advanced machine learning models, each trained independently, to better predict bird species. Specifically, we utilized models like <code>tf_efficientnet_b4</code> and <code>resnetv2_101</code>, achieving our highest score of 0.66 with the latter after 50 training epochs. Other models like <code>eca_nfnet_l0</code> and <code>mobilenetv3_large_100_miil_in21k</code> scored 0.62 and 0.60, respectively, demonstrating robust performance across varied audio datasets. We are also currently evaluating an enhanced ensemble strategy that combines two powerful models, <code>mobilenetv3_large_100_miil_in21k</code> and <code>resnetv2_50</code>, using an optimization tool called ONNX to further improve processing efficiency and model performance. Together, <code>mobilenet</code> and <code>resnetv2_50</code> achieved a combined score of 0.59.</p>
            <p>However, not all attempts were successful; models such as <code>seresnext101_32x4d</code> and <code>eca_nfnet_l2</code> timed out, likely due to their large size which made processing within Kaggle's constraints challenging. Participating in Kaggle proved difficult due to several limitations, including no internet access during submission, an unorganized file system, and the lack of GPU usage, which significantly hindered our ability to utilize more computationally intensive models effectively.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, our team achieved an impressive 80/780, earning a bronze medal in the competition. This accomplishment underscores the effectiveness of our ensemble strategy in handling the complex task of bird species identification from audio data, even within the restrictive environment of a competitive Kaggle contest.</p>
