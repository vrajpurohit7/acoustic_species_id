            <h2>Welcome to the Acoustic Species Identification Project</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on classifying bird vocalizations and extends previous work from Engineers for Exploration (E4E). We are developing techniques to overcome challenges in audio data classification due to domain shift from labeled training data to unlabeled, noisy field recordings.</p>
            <p>Our objective is to leverage modern machine learning architectures and domain-specific adaptations to accurately identify bird species from acoustic data. This work is part of our broader efforts to aid ecological research and conservation through advanced bioacoustic classification systems.</p>
            <p>Currently, we are working on implementing and evaluating various machine learning models, including CNNs and newer RNN architectures, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our identification systems. Our work contributes to the BirdCLEF 2024 competition on Kaggle, aiming to push the boundaries of current bioacoustic research.</p>

          <h2>Ensemble Learning Strategy</h2>
          <p>We use ensemble learning methods to make our bird species identification more accurate. This approach combines several smart learning programs, each trained independently, to enhance their ability to predict bird species accurately. By blending the results from different models, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we gain a deeper understanding of the patterns in the sounds they analyze. This method helps our system avoid focusing too narrowly on one type of sound, allowing it to adapt to varied environments where birds are recorded. Importantly, it also helps prevent our system from overfitting, which means it won't just memorize specific sounds from the training data but will perform well even in new, challenging situations like those found in the BirdCLEF contest.</p>
